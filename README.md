# Marvel Heroes Project

This project is dedicated to Marvel heroes and leverages the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/) to provide information about characters and comics from the Marvel Universe.

## Project Overview

The Marvel Heroes Project allows users to explore Marvel characters and comics. You can load Marvel heroes, select a specific hero, and view detailed information on the right. Heroes can be found randomly or through a search feature. After a search, if a hero is found, you can navigate to their dedicated page. The project also features two buttons allowing users to visit the Homepage and WIKI on the official Marvel site (https://www.marvel.com/). Note that sometimes the Homepage and WIKI might not provide additional information about the selected heroes.

The second page is dedicated to Marvel comics. Clicking on a specific comic takes you to its individual page.
